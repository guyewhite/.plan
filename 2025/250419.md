## Thoughts
* If the system did not anticipate the ways the user would muck it up, the system needs updating.
* If a user has to wait for an admin to fix something, that is indicative of a bug that needs to be fixed.

## Tasks and Fixes
* Created EK repo.
* Learned about docker files.
* Created my own docker.
* Learned about database load balancing and shards.

## Enhancements
* Reconceptualized EK as a product that can be white labeled.

## To Do
* Learn about licencing models for white labeled SAS.

## Music
